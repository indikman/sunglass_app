# ARFoundation Sample - Sunglass Configurator

This is a quick, yet fun implementation of ARFoundation demonstrating the use of AR wearable Ecommerce

This contains a range of colours and textures that you can choose to showcase one Sunglass model.

Works with Android devices with AR Core support and iOS devices with ARKit and the radar front camera (iPhones with the notch!)

Following is a sample showcase of the app running on a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
